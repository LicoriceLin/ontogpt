# Evaluations

OpenAI's functions have been evaluated on test data sets.

All evaluation results include OpenAI cache databases (`openai_cache.db.gz`) as a reference of the prompts and responses obtained during the evaluation. This may be used by extracting the cache database to the root directory of the project.
